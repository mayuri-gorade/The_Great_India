    <h2>Indian Freedom Fighter</h2>
    <p>One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than Subhas Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose belonged to the extremist section of the Indian freedom fighters. He was the leader of a radical youth wing of Congress from the early years of the 1920s till the end of 1930. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.</p>

    <h2>Indian Sport Leader</h2>
    <p>India has given gems to the world. Then may it be legendary leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, visionaries like APJ Abdul Kalam and Swami Vivekanand, or scientists like CV Raman and Homi Bhabha. The field of sports is also not different.

        We have seen legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Mary Kom, and Dhyan Chand who not only made a name for themselves but also took the level of their respective sports to another level.

    <h2>Indian political Leader</h2>
    <p>Politics of India works within the framework of the country's Constitution. India is a parliamentary democratic republic in which the President of India is the head of state and the Prime Minister of India is the head of government. It is based on the federal structure of government, although the word is not used in the Constitution itself. India follows the dual polity system, i.e. federal in nature, that consists of the central authority at the centre and states at the periphery. The Constitution defines the organisational powers and limitations of both central and state governments; it is well recognised, fluid (Preamble of the Constitution being rigid and to dictate further amendments to the Constitution) and considered supreme, i.e. the laws of the nation must conform to it.</p>
